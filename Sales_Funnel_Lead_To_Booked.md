This was the first funnel view showing leads to booked with conversion rates ever created for this org at Adobe. I worked closely with Marketing to ensure my data was in sync with theirs. With expanded visibility into the wide range of conversion rates, BDRs and Marketing entered a new era of collaboration on lead routing practices and Marketing lead quality accountability. 

Note: I changed all numbers to maintain confidentiality.
